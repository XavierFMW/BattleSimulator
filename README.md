# Battle Simulator

A European battle simulator based on a series of videos by the Geography and Gaming YouTuber Drew Durnil. Based on the content of the videos, I 
believe his process could be automated, so I wrote a script in Python using the PyGame module to recreate the content in the videos.

The simulation features a map which changes based on which nations possess which areas of land, and the ideology they follow.

Anyone is free to edit any of this code however they please. If you modify this code, I ask you send me whatever you've made, it's always cool to see
what people do with stuff you've made.
